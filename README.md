# Water-Conformer-Generator
This script generates hydrogen conformers for water. The script has 2 options:
1- To generate random hydrogen positions
2- To generate hydrogen positions given a metal that connects to the water's oxygen. 
In this case, all hydrogens will be pointing away from the metal.
